## Design
I want my website to be a calm and inviting place for the user that I feel befits people with dogs. 
Therefore, I want to use colours that reflect this enviornment.
I used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/ "Coolors.co") to choose a suitable colour scheme.

### Fonts
Because the website is designed to be a emotionally connective environment. I wanted the font selection to be in keeping with this.
I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to choose a style
The style i went with is.........


### Icons
I will use icons to make the site more visably appealing to the user. They will be in keeping with the style of the site.
I have used [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome"), to choose the icons

### Images
For the carousel and the portfolio the images are from my own personal collection.
The image for the contact section is a stock photo from a google serarch, found here ********

### Colours
The reason I have choosen this pallete, is that I feel the colours suit the style I wanted to give. A calm inviting place, engaging the emotions of a dog owner.
The colour scheme I have chosen can be seen here *****

### Structure
To build the structure of the website, I have gone with
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) 
This will give the foundation to construct a responsive website, that I can then style with CSS.
Bootstrap is mobile first by default and I can adapt to work with tablets and computers


## **Wireframes**
I have used [Balsamic](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) to create the wireframes for my website. 
I have created a basic wireframe for desktop and mobile. 
The website is a single scrolling page, that will provide a focused, simple to navigate place for the user experience
