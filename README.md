## **Design**
I want my website to be a calm and inviting place for the user, that I feel befits people with dogs. 
Therefore, I want to use colours that reflect this enviornment.
I used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/ "Coolors.co") to choose a suitable colour scheme.

### **Fonts**
Because the website is designed to be an emotionally connective environment. I wanted the font selection to be in keeping with this.
I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to choose a style
The style I went with is Montserrat.


### **Icons**

I have used [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome"), to choose the icons for the media buttons

### **Images**
For the carousel and the portfolio the images are from my own personal collection.
The logo of the black dog was from stock images free to download that I found at:
**[Dog Logo](https://www.cleanpng.com/png-labrador-retriever-puppy-boxer-silhouette-dachshun-7025733/)**

### **Colours**
The reason I have choosen this pallete, is that I feel the colours suit the style I wanted to give. A calm inviting place, engaging the emotions of a dog owner.
The colour scheme I have chosen can be seen here:
**[Coolors](https://coolors.co/8e9aaf-cbc0d3-efd3d7-feeafa-dee2ff)**

* #FEEAFA is the colour I used for the main background. I wanted a colour that would soft to the eyes and nbot dominate the page.
* #DEE2FF I decided to use for the header. I needed a colour that seperate the navbar from the background colour, but again a soft pallete.
I also used this colour for the text fields and the portfolio images to give them seperation.
* #8E9AAF i was going to use this colour for the main text. however, I discovered that the contrast was too low and coluld not be seen clearly.
I did not want to use black, so I went with a darker gray
which is: #545C68

### **Structure**
To build the structure of the website, I have gone with **[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)** 
This will give the foundation to construct a responsive website, that I can then style with **[CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets)**
Bootstrap is mobile first by default and this will allow me to adapt the website for tablets and computers.


[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### **Wireframes**
I have used **[Balsamic](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/)** to create the wireframes for my website. 
I have created a basic wireframe for desktop and mobile. 
The website is a single scrolling page, that will provide a focused, simple to navigate place for the user experience.

 **View the Wireframes here:**

## **Features**
 **Existing Features**
#### **Navigation**
At the top is a page a title. Underneath is a responsive Navbar using Bootstrap to deploy this.
When viewed with a mobile phone the tabs will be incorporated into a "hamburger" style dropdown tab.

#### **Carousel**
Below the Navbar, I have used a carousel to provide a sliding view showing images of dogs that I have taken.
I want the user to imagine their dog having images like these.

#### **About**
the next section has an image of myself, the photographer with my dog Jasper. Within this section, is information about myself. 
I want the user to develop a connection through reading the About section. 

#### **Portfolio**
This section will display a portfolio of images
I want to give the user further variety of my work, to enjoy and help choose my service.

#### **Prices**
Using Bootstrap, I have made cards that show three price packages for the user to choose from. 
I wanted to give a clear seperation and uniformity for this section.

#### **Contact**
A contact section will allow the user to ask the photographer further information specific to their requirements.

#### **Footer**
The footer will have links to social media homepage, that will open in a new tab.
The icons are taken from the **[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)** website.


 **Features Requiring Future Implemention**
* Add purchase buttons that link to a booking page when selecting a price package
* To make the contact section link to the photographer's email
* A contract to be completed when booking a photography package

## **Testing**
### **Navigation Bar**
**Plan**    
A navigation bar will be fixed at the top of the screen.
Scrolling up and down the site, the navigation bar is always acessible.
Using a button will take the user to the relevant section.
For mobile use, the "hamburger" icon will appear, that will give a dropdown to the buttons.

**Implementation**
To achieve the navbar structure, I have used Bootstrap to implement this.
CSS has been used to style the navbar to complement the overall website.
Bootstrap is used to default to the "hamburger" icon in the mobile form.

**Test**
I have checked to operation of all the buttons to see they work properly. I have done this in desktop, tablet and mobile form. Also I confirmed the "hamburger" icon appears when in the mobile form.
The website was opened in Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge and Apple Safari, to test consisitency across all platforms.

**Result**
The navbar works in desktop, tablet and mobile view.
The layout looked good and all the buttons worked properly.
It took me sometime to get the layout how I wanted. With help from the slack community and google search, I got the navbar how I wanted it to look.

**Verdict**
The navbar worked with no issues found.

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### **Carousel**
**Plan**
Below the navbar, I wanted to capture the users eye with a constant flow of images.
The user can interact with the carousel using action tabs either side of the images

**Implementation**
I used Bootstrap to implement the carousel.
With Bootstrap the carousel will adapt when viewed through various devices.
I further styled the carousel with CSS to compliment the overall design of the website

**Test**
I tested that the carousel worked properly when used with a desktop, tablet and a mobile.
I tested that the carousel worked using Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge and Apple Safari

**Result**
The carousel auto slides to the next image as I wanted.
This worked in desktop, tablet and a mobile.

**Verdict**
The carousel was implemented and worked well.

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)
### **About**

**Plan**
I designed a simple About section, to provide information about the photographer and so develop a connection for the user.
I also added a photo of the photographer with his dog to put a face with the name. I believed this helped with an emotional connection with the user.

**Implementation**
I used Bootstrap to place a photo with a written description section next to the photo.
I styled the section in keeping with the overall look of the website using CSS
When viewed with a mobile device, I wanted the photo to move above the description so that both were still easy to see

**Test**
I tested that the About worked properly when used with a desktop, tablet and a mobile.
I tested it was consistent when using Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge and Apple Safari.
When viewed using a mobile device I checked that the photo moved above the text as I wished and was easy to read

**Result**
The responsiveness of the About section was good.
The image of the photographer was to the side of the written section as I wanted and they dropped into line when reducing down to a mobile view.

**Verdict**
A good implementation of the About section. 
This is exactly how I wanted it to be seen.

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)
### **Pricing**
**Plan**

For a good user experience I wanted to give a clear, concise interface for the user to choose a price package. 
I did not want to overwhelm with information and choice options.
For this reason I decided to present three cards, side by side, styled in keeping with the overall website design.
I needed the cards to stack vertically when viewed using a mobile device, so that they are still clear to read.
The cards will have the same structure with three different price options. I wanted to make it simple for the user to compare.
I want to make the cards interactive and add a select button, so that when selected they will take the user to a booking form.
However, I have not obtained the necessary skills to achieve this yet. The plan is to add this later in my course. 

**Implementation**
Again using Bootstrap I went with a design using cards.
Bootstrap will allow the cards to align vertically when viewed in a mobile device, that will give the desired uniform presentation that I wanted for the user.
I further styled with CSS to compliment the overall website

**Test**
When used with a desktop and tablet the cards were uniform horizontally and vertically when used with a mobile device.
I tested that the cards were constant using Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge and Apple Safari.

**Result**
The pricing section responded properly, with the three cards dropping into line in the mobile view.
**Verdict**
This is a simple pricing section. At this stage I did not want to add to it. With more knowledge, this can be expanded on.

### **Contact Form** 
**Plan**    
For a good user experience, the user must be able to contact the photographer for many different reasons.
I have added a Contact form where they can provide their name, email and content box to enter their message.
A submit button is provided for the user to send to the photographer.
At present, the submit button will not send the message to the photographer as I have not learnt these skills yet.



 **Implementation**    
I have referred to the course content at Code Institute, Building the Running website, to design a contact form. I liked the design and would complement my website.
I have styled the Contact form with CSS to compliment the rest of the website.

 **Test**    
 The Contact form was tested to see that it was responsive when used with a desktop, tablet and mobile device.
I tested that the form work using Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge and Apple Safari.
The submit button will not send the message to the photographer, as I do not have the skills to incorporate this as yet.

**Result**
The contact form responds how I expected it to in desktop, tablet and mobile device.
The submit does not work. This can be implemented with further knowledge gain in the course.

**Verdict**
As the form is a present, it worked how I wanted.

### **Bugs**

**Footer**
* Bug
I was having issues to put the media buttons central and with equal spacing, plus also being responsive.

* Fix
* Requested advice from the Slack community, where I got
  help. Also used W3schools site and Bootstrap documentation.
  
 
 * Verdict 
  The icons are central, spaced correctly and responsive.
  
**Navbar**
  * Bug
    I had the menu tabs styled to the right hand side but were not responsive. I had to style the correctly.

  * fix
    I found a site with a youtube video [here](https://codetime.io/series/how-to-create-navbars-with-bootstrap-4/episode/creating-a-navbar-with-right-aligned-links) that gave me the information required
    I needed to add 'ml-auto' to the ul element.
    I also recieved the same advice from the slack community.
   * Verdict
    The menu tabs are responsive and change down to a "Hamburger" icon in the mobile view.

 **Submit Button**
  * Bug
    The button does not send the message when pressed.

  * Fix
  * At present the skills I have means this cannot be implemented now.
  * Verdict
    This can be implemented in the future when further along in the course.     
  
 **Social Media Links**
  * Bug
    The links only go to the respective website home pages.

  * Fix
    I do not have social media sites dedicated to Dog Photography, therefore this is why I have used the default websites.

  * Verdict
    The buttons work properly, how I anticipated.
