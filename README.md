Therefore, I want to use colours that reflect this enviornment.
I used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/ "Coolors.co") to choose a suitable colour scheme.

Because the website is designed to be a emotionally connective environment. I wanted the font selection to be in keeping with this.
I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to choose a style
The style i went with is.........


### Icons
I will use icons to make the site more visably appealing to the user. They will be in keeping with the style of the site.
I have used [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome"), to choose the icons

### Images
For the carousel and the portfolio the images are from my own personal collection.
The image for the contact section is a stock photo from a google serarch, found here ********
