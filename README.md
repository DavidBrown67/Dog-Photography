## **Design**
I want my website to be a calm and inviting place for the user that I feel befits people with dogs. 
Therefore, I want to use colours that reflect this enviornment.
I used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/ "Coolors.co") to choose a suitable colour scheme.

### **Fonts**
Because the website is designed to be a emotionally connective environment. I wanted the font selection to be in keeping with this.
I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to choose a style
The style i went with is.........


### **Icons**
I will use icons to make the site more visably appealing to the user. They will be in keeping with the style of the site.
I have used [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome"), to choose the icons

### **Images**
For the carousel and the portfolio the images are from my own personal collection.
The image for the contact section is a stock photo from a google serarch, found here ********

### **Colours**
The reason I have choosen this pallete, is that I feel the colours suit the style I wanted to give. A calm inviting place, engaging the emotions of a dog owner.
The colour scheme I have chosen can be seen here *****

### **Structure**
To build the structure of the website, I have gone with **[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)** 
This will give the foundation to construct a responsive website, that I can then style with [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets)
Bootstrap is mobile first by default and this will allow me to adapt the website for tablets and computers


### **Wireframes**
I have used **[Balsamic](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/)** to create the wireframes for my website. 
I have created a basic wireframe for desktop and mobile. 
The website is a single scrolling page, that will provide a focused, simple to navigate place for the user experience

## **Features**
### **Existing Features**
#### **Navigation**
At the top is a page a title. Underneath is a responsive Navbar using Bootstrap to deploy this.
When viewed with a mobile phone the tabs will be incorporated into a "hamburger" style dropdown tab

#### **Carousel**
Below the Navbar, I have used a carousel to provide a sliding view showing images of dogs that I have taken.
I want the user to image their dog having images like these

#### **About**
the next section has an image of myself, the photographer with my dog Jasper. Within this section, is information about myself. I want the user develop a connection through reading the About section 

#### **Portfolio**
This section will display a portfolio of images
I want to give the user further variety of my work, to enjoy and help choose my service

#### **Prices**
Using Bootstrap I have made cards that show 3 price packages for the user to choose from. 
I wanted to give clear seperation and uniformity
