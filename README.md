## **Design**
I want my website to be a calm and inviting place for the user that I feel befits people with dogs. 
Therefore, I want to use colours that reflect this enviornment.
I used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/ "Coolors.co") to choose a suitable colour scheme.

### **Fonts**
Because the website is designed to be a emotionally connective environment. I wanted the font selection to be in keeping with this.
I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to choose a style
The style I went with is.........


### **Icons**
I will use icons to make the site more visably appealing to the user. They will be in keeping with the style of the site.
I have used [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome"), to choose the icons

### **Images**
For the carousel and the portfolio the images are from my own personal collection.
The image for the contact section is a stock photo from a google search, found here ********

### **Colours**
The reason I have choosen this pallete, is that I feel the colours suit the style I wanted to give. A calm inviting place, engaging the emotions of a dog owner.
The colour scheme I have chosen can be seen here *****

### **Structure**
To build the structure of the website, I have gone with **[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)** 
This will give the foundation to construct a responsive website, that I can then style with [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets)
Bootstrap is mobile first by default and this will allow me to adapt the website for tablets and computers

### **Wireframes**
I have used **[Balsamic](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/)** to create the wireframes for my website. 
I have created a basic wireframe for desktop and mobile. 
The website is a single scrolling page, that will provide a focused, simple to navigate place for the user experience

## **Features**
### **Existing Features**
#### **Navigation**
At the top is a page a title. Underneath is a responsive Navbar using Bootstrap to deploy this.
When viewed with a mobile phone the tabs will be incorporated into a "hamburger" style dropdown tab

#### **Carousel**
Below the Navbar, I have used a carousel to provide a sliding view showing images of dogs that I have taken.
I want the user to image their dog having images like these

#### **About**
the next section has an image of myself, the photographer with my dog Jasper. Within this section, is information about myself. 
I want the user develop a connection through reading the About section 

#### **Portfolio**
This section will display a portfolio of images
I want to give the user further variety of my work, to enjoy and help choose my service

#### **Prices**
Using Bootstrap, I have made cards that show 3 price packages for the user to choose from. 
I wanted to give a clear seperation and uniformity for this section

#### **Contact**
A contact section will allow the user to ask the photographer further information specific to their requirements

#### **Footer**
The footer will have links to social media homepage, that will open in a new tab.
The icons are taken from the **[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)** website
A copyright to protect the photographer's rights

### **Features Requiring Future Implemention**

## **Testing**
### **Navigation Bar**
**Plan**    
A navigation bar will be fixed at the top of the screen.
Scrolling up and down the site, the navigation bar is always acessible.
Using a button will take the user to the relevant section
For mobile use, the "hamburger" icon will appear, that will give a dropdown to the buttons.

**Implementation**
To achieve the navbar structure, I have used Bootstrap to implement this.
CSS has been used to style the navbar to complement the overall website.
Bootstrap is used to default to the "hamburger" icon in the mobile form.

**Test**
I have checked to operation of all the buttons to see they work properly. I have done this in desktop, tablet and mobile form. Also i confirmed the "hamburger" icon appears when in the mibile form.
The website was opened in Google chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge and Apple Safari, to test consisitency across all platforms.

**Result**

**Verdict**

### **Carousel**
**Plan**
Below the navbar, I wanted to capture the users eye with a constant flow of images.
The user can interact with the carousel using action tabs either side of the images

**Implementation**
I used Bootstrap to implement the carousel.
With Bootstrap the carousel will adapt when viewed through various devices.
I further styled the carousel with CSS to compliment the overall design of the website

**Test**
I tested that the carousel worked properly when used with a desktop, tablet and a mobile.
I tested that the carousel worked using Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge and Apple Safari

**Result**
